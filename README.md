## The Guardian News

This app allows you to check the latest news in the world thanks to the API provided by the [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk). You can check all the information about how to use [here](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/).

The purpose of this application is, first of all, to offer a simple example of the use of Clean architecture using Kotlin and its many advantages over Java. In second place, this project also constitutes a repository of functionalities and utilities that are usually needed daily for the development of Android applications. If you dive into the code, you'll get more details.

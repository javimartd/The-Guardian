/**
 * Important guiding principles for MVVM implementation:
 *
 * - ViewModels must not reference Views directly because
 * if this is done, ViewModels can outlive the Viewâ€™s lifecycle and memory leakage can happen.
 *
 * - Model and ViewModel are recommended to expose their data using LiveData since LiveData,
 * Unlike a regular observable, respects the lifecycle state of app components (activities,
 * fragments, services) and handles object life cycle management which ensures that LiveData
 * objects do not leak.
 *
 * ViewModel retains its data during configuration changes. This means that after configuration
 * changes, this ViewModel data is immediately available to the next activity or fragment instance.
 *
 * LiveData is an observable data holder. This allows the components in your app to be able
 * to observe LiveData objects for changes without creating explicit and rigid dependency
 * paths between them. Is used to make the task of implementing ViewModel easier.
 *
 * You can forget if the activity is destroyed or not, so you can disconnect from its life
 * cycle and do your work at any time. Thanks to ViewModel and LiveData, you don't need to
 * worry when the activity is recreated or when it is destroyed.
 *
 * With LiveData, the data will not be updated when your View is in the background.
 *
 * LiveData is immutable by default (you cannot change its value).

     * Expose the LiveData News so the UI can observe it.

     * A good practice that helps us limit the modification of MutableLiveData to the
     * class is to return it as LiveData. This is because the setValue and postValue
     * methods are not implemented in LiveData, so they cannot be modified outside of this class.
     *
     * If we need it to be modified, it is better to add a function that updates it rather than
     * exposing it as MutableLiveData:
